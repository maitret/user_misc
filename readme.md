## Intro

This project will be another simple MEN stack project. I'm not 100% sure where it will go as I start it. After a few days of working on this project, it finally has a true direction! I have decided that I will be use API's on a lot of my MEN projects that I work on. Thus, this project uses the NASA API to give the user a rather blurry satellite photo of an address that they type in. I do use Google's geocoder API to convert the address to lat/long coordinates. Thus, this project should have been called satellite or something along those lines!
